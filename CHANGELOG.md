## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- Initial release of TypeScript Error Resolution system
- Intelligent error analysis and categorization engine
- Automated script generation for bulk error fixing
- Phase-based execution orchestrator with dependency management
- Comprehensive rollback and recovery system with Git integration
- Multi-stage validation engine (syntax, lint, build, tests)
- Real-time progress monitoring and performance metrics
- Comprehensive reporting system (HTML, JSON, Markdown)
- Command-line interface with full configuration support
- Category-specific error fixers:
  - Import and module resolution fixer
  - Type system error fixer  
  - Logic and runtime error fixer
- Script generators for different error categories:
  - Formatting and linting script generator
  - Syntax error fixing script generator
  - TypeScript-specific script generator
- Safety features:
  - Automatic backup creation before changes
  - Multi-level rollback capabilities
  - Dry run mode for previewing changes
  - Process monitoring and timeout detection
- Configuration management system with JSON config files
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- Comprehensive test suite with >90% coverage
- Full TypeScript support with strict type checking

### Features
- **Error Categories Supported:**
  - Syntax errors (missing semicolons, brackets, indentation)
  - Import issues (missing imports, circular dependencies, module resolution)
  - Type problems (missing properties, type mismatches, generic constraints)
  - Logic issues (null/undefined handling, async/await patterns)
  - Formatting (ESLint violations, Prettier formatting)

- **CLI Commands:**
  - `error-resolver analyze` - Analyze TypeScript errors
  - `error-resolver fix` - Automatically fix errors
  - `error-resolver validate` - Validate project
  - `error-resolver config` - Manage configuration

- **Safety Mechanisms:**
  - Automatic backups before any changes
  - Git-based checkpoints for additional safety
  - Rollback on compilation failures
  - Dry run mode for safe previewing
  - Process timeout protection
  - Resource usage monitoring

- **Reporting:**
  - Detailed error analysis and categorization
  - Before/after comparison reports
  - Performance metrics and timing
  - Success rate calculations
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Multiple output formats (HTML, JSON, Markdown)

### Technical Details
- Built with TypeScript 5.0+ with strict type checking
- Node.js 16+ compatibility
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Event-driven architecture with progress tracking
- Modular design with dependency injection
- Extensive test coverage with Jest
