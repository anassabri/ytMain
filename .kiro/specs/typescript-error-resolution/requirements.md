# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on implementing an intelligent, systematic TypeScript error resolution system for bulk fixing all compilation errors in the codebase. The goal is to create automated scripts and strategies that can categorize, prioritize, and systematically resolve TypeScript errors with minimal manual intervention while maintaining code quality and functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an automated error analysis system, so that all TypeScript errors are categorized and prioritized for systematic resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `npm run type-check` is executed THEN the system SHALL capture and analyze all TypeScript compilation errors
2. WHEN errors are analyzed THEN the system SHALL categorize them by root cause (import issues, type mismatches, missing properties, syntax errors)
3. WHEN errors are categorized THEN the system SHALL prioritize them by impact and dependency order
4. IF error patterns are detected THEN the system SHALL group similar errors for bulk resolution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want intelligent bulk fixing scripts, so that errors can be resolved efficiently in batches without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error categories are identified THEN the system SHALL generate category-specific fixing scripts
2. WHEN fixing scripts run THEN the system SHALL apply fixes to all errors of that category simultaneously
3. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL validate that errors are resolved without introducing new issues
4. IF fixes fail THEN the system SHALL rollback changes and report the failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want systematic error resolution workflow, so that errors are fixed in the correct order without creating dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting error resolution THEN the system SHALL fix formatting and linting issues first
2. WHEN formatting is complete THEN the system SHALL resolve syntax errors second
3. WHEN syntax errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL address logical and structural issues last
4. IF any category has remaining errors THEN the system SHALL not proceed to the next category until current category reaches zero errors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated script orchestration, so that the entire error resolution process runs autonomously with proper monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN orchestration starts THEN the system SHALL execute all error-fixing scripts in the correct sequence
2. WHEN each script completes THEN the system SHALL verify error count reduction and log progress
3. WHEN timeouts occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without hanging
4. IF the process gets stuck THEN the system SHALL detect and recover from subprocess issues

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want cache and error file cleanup, so that stale errors and cached issues don't interfere with the resolution process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting error resolution THEN the system SHALL delete all files containing cached errors
2. WHEN clearing cache THEN the system SHALL remove TypeScript build cache and temporary files
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL preserve source files while removing error artifacts
4. IF cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL report which files couldn't be cleaned and continue

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want modern best practices applied during error fixing, so that the codebase is improved while resolving errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fixing deprecated syntax THEN the system SHALL update to modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
2. WHEN improving error handling THEN the system SHALL implement proper try-catch blocks and error boundaries
3. WHEN ensuring code style THEN the system SHALL apply consistent formatting and linting rules
4. IF functionality changes THEN the system SHALL maintain existing behavior while improving code quality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive validation and monitoring, so that the error resolution process completes successfully with zero TypeScript errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation runs THEN the system SHALL confirm `npm run type-check` reports zero errors
2. WHEN monitoring execution THEN the system SHALL track progress and detect stuck processes
3. WHEN process completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report of all fixes applied
4. IF errors remain THEN the system SHALL identify why they weren't resolved and suggest manual intervention

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reusable and documented error-fixing scripts, so that the solution can be maintained and extended for future use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scripts are created THEN the system SHALL document their purpose, usage, and error patterns they address
2. WHEN scripts are organized THEN the system SHALL structure them for easy maintenance and reuse
3. WHEN new error types emerge THEN the system SHALL allow easy extension of existing scripts
4. IF scripts need updates THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidelines for modification and testing
