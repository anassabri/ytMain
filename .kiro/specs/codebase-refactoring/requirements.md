# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive refactoring and error fixing across the entire YouTube-like application codebase. The goal is to identify, analyze, and resolve all existing errors, improve code quality, eliminate technical debt, and ensure the application runs smoothly with optimal performance and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors fixed, so that the application builds successfully without any type-related issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the TypeScript compiler runs THEN the system SHALL produce zero compilation errors
2. WHEN type checking is performed THEN the system SHALL validate all type definitions are correct and consistent
3. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL resolve all import/export statements without errors
4. IF there are missing type definitions THEN the system SHALL provide proper type declarations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all ESLint and code quality issues resolved, so that the codebase follows consistent coding standards and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ESLint runs THEN the system SHALL report zero linting errors
2. WHEN code analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL identify and fix all code quality violations
3. WHEN checking for unused imports THEN the system SHALL remove all dead code and unused dependencies
4. IF there are formatting inconsistencies THEN the system SHALL apply consistent code formatting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all runtime errors and console warnings eliminated, so that the application runs without any JavaScript errors or warnings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL execute without throwing any runtime errors
2. WHEN navigating between pages THEN the system SHALL not produce any console errors or warnings
3. WHEN components render THEN the system SHALL handle all edge cases without crashing
4. IF there are deprecated API usages THEN the system SHALL update to current API standards

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate code and redundant components eliminated, so that the codebase is DRY and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing components THEN the system SHALL identify and consolidate duplicate functionality
2. WHEN reviewing utilities THEN the system SHALL merge redundant helper functions
3. WHEN checking imports THEN the system SHALL eliminate circular dependencies
4. IF there are similar components THEN the system SHALL create reusable abstractions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error boundaries and error handling implemented, so that the application gracefully handles all error scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL catch and handle it appropriately
2. WHEN components fail to render THEN the system SHALL display meaningful error messages
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide proper error feedback to users
4. IF there are unhandled promise rejections THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all test files updated and passing, so that the refactored code maintains reliability and quality assurance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run THEN the system SHALL execute all test suites successfully
2. WHEN code is refactored THEN the system SHALL update corresponding test files
3. WHEN new utilities are created THEN the system SHALL provide adequate test coverage
4. IF tests are outdated THEN the system SHALL update them to match current implementation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want optimized imports and dependency management, so that the application has minimal bundle size and fast loading times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bundling the application THEN the system SHALL use tree-shaking to eliminate unused code
2. WHEN importing libraries THEN the system SHALL use specific imports instead of entire libraries
3. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL identify and remove unused packages
4. IF there are heavy dependencies THEN the system SHALL implement lazy loading where appropriate

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent file organization and naming conventions, so that the codebase is easy to navigate and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing files THEN the system SHALL follow consistent directory structure patterns
2. WHEN naming components THEN the system SHALL use consistent naming conventions
3. WHEN structuring folders THEN the system SHALL group related functionality logically
4. IF there are misplaced files THEN the system SHALL relocate them to appropriate directories
