## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send details to security@example.com
2. **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Encrypted Communication**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to the following timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Confirmation**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly until resolution
- **Resolution**: Varies based on complexity and severity

### Disclosure Policy

We follow a coordinated disclosure approach:

1. **Report received** and acknowledged
2. **Investigation** and confirmation of the vulnerability
3. **Fix development** and testing
4. **Security advisory** preparation
5. **Release** of patched version
6. **Public disclosure** after users have had time to update

## Security Measures

### Application Security

Our application implements several security measures:

#### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- Type checking with TypeScript
- Schema validation for API requests
- File upload restrictions and validation

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure authentication flows
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management

#### Data Protection
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Secure API communication (HTTPS)
- Environment variable protection
- Secure cookie handling

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Input sanitization
- Output encoding
- React's built-in XSS protection

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention
- CSRF tokens
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Origin validation

#### API Security
- Rate limiting
- API key management
- Request validation
- Error handling without information disclosure

### Infrastructure Security

#### Development Environment
- Secure development practices
- Code review requirements
- Automated security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability checking

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- Secure build processes
- Secret management
- Automated security tests
- Container scanning

#### Deployment
- Secure deployment practices
- Environment isolation
- Access controls
- Monitoring and logging

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm update
   ```

2. **Use Environment Variables**
   ```javascript
   // Good
   const apiKey = process.env.VITE_API_KEY;
   
   // Bad
   const apiKey = 'hardcoded-key';
   ```

3. **Validate All Inputs**
   ```typescript
   const validateInput = (input: string): boolean => {
     return input.length > 0 && input.length < 1000;
   };
   ```

4. **Use HTTPS Everywhere**
   ```typescript
   const apiUrl = process.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL; // https://api.example.com
   ```

5. **Implement Proper Error Handling**
   ```typescript
   try {
     // API call
   } catch (error) {
     // Log error securely, don't expose sensitive info
     console.error('API Error:', error.message);
   }
   ```

### For Users

1. **Keep Your Installation Updated**
   - Regularly update to the latest version
   - Subscribe to security notifications

2. **Use Strong API Keys**
   - Generate strong, unique API keys
   - Rotate keys regularly
   - Store keys securely

3. **Monitor Your Usage**
   - Review access logs
   - Monitor for unusual activity
   - Report suspicious behavior

## Security Tools

### Automated Security Scanning

We use the following tools for security scanning:

- **npm audit**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
