# Code Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring strategy for the YouTube Studio clone application to improve code maintainability, reduce duplication, and enhance performance.

## Identified Issues

### 1. Code Duplication
- **Loading Skeletons**: Multiple pages implement similar skeleton loading patterns
- **Error States**: Repetitive error handling UI across components
- **State Management**: Similar useState patterns for loading, error, and data states
- **Grid Layouts**: Repeated video grid layout code
- **Form Handling**: Similar form state management patterns

### 2. Component Complexity
- **WatchPage**: Large component with multiple responsibilities (1100+ lines)
- **ContentManagerPage**: Complex state management with many useState calls
- **Header**: Multiple dropdown menus with similar logic
- **AdvancedVideoPlayer**: Large component that could be split

### 3. Hook Opportunities
- **Form Management**: Custom hook for form state and validation
- **Modal State**: Reusable hook for modal open/close logic
- **Local Storage**: Hook for persisting data to localStorage
- **Debounced Input**: Hook for search and input debouncing

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Reusable UI Components
1. **PageLayout Component**: Standardize page structure with header, loading, error states
2. **VideoGrid Component**: Reusable grid layout for videos
3. **Modal Components**: Base modal with common functionality
4. **Form Components**: Reusable form inputs with validation

### Phase 2: Extract Custom Hooks
1. **useFormState**: Form state management and validation
2. **useModal**: Modal open/close state management
3. **useLocalStorage**: Persistent state management
4. **useDebounce**: Debounced value hook
5. **usePagination**: Pagination logic

### Phase 3: Component Decomposition
1. **Split WatchPage**: Extract comment section, video info, related videos
2. **Refactor Header**: Extract dropdown components
3. **Break down ContentManagerPage**: Extract filters, bulk actions

### Phase 4: Performance Optimizations
1. **Memoization**: Add React.memo and useMemo where appropriate
2. **Lazy Loading**: Implement component lazy loading
3. **Virtual Scrolling**: For large lists

## Implementation Priority
1. High Impact, Low Risk: Reusable UI components
2. Medium Impact, Low Risk: Custom hooks
3. High Impact, Medium Risk: Component decomposition
4. Medium Impact, Medium Risk: Performance optimizations

## Success Metrics
- Reduce code duplication by 40%
- Decrease average component size by 30%
- Improve bundle size by 15%
- Maintain 100% functionality
