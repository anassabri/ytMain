# Admin Page YouTube API Selection Fix

## Issue Fixed
When selecting "Google Custom Search JSON API" as the YouTube Search Provider in the admin page, the YouTube Data API v3 option was incorrectly showing as "Not Configured" and became permanently disabled, preventing users from switching back to YouTube API.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by the `isYouTubeApiAvailable()` function returning `false` when YouTube Data API was blocked (due to Google Custom Search being selected). The admin page was using this function to determine:
1. Whether to disable the YouTube API radio button
2. Whether to show "Not Configured" status
3. Whether to display the missing API key error

This created a circular problem where selecting Google Custom Search would make YouTube API appear unconfigured, even though the API key was present.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Separated Configuration from Availability
Created two distinct functions in `services/settingsService.ts`:

```typescript
// Check if YouTube Data API is configured (has API key)
export const isYouTubeApiConfigured = (): boolean => {
  const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_YOUTUBE_API_KEY;
  return !!apiKey;
};

// Check if YouTube Data API is available for use (configured and not blocked)
export const isYouTubeApiAvailable = (): boolean => {
  return isYouTubeApiConfigured() && !isYouTubeDataApiBlocked();
};
```

### 2. Updated Admin Page Logic
Modified `pages/AdminPage.tsx` to use appropriate functions:

- **Radio Button Enablement**: Uses `isYouTubeApiConfigured()` - allows switching even when blocked
- **Status Display**: Shows different badges based on state:
  - "Not Configured" (red) - when API key is missing
  - "Disabled" (yellow) - when configured but blocked by Google Custom Search selection
  - "Available" (green) - when configured and not blocked

### 3. Enhanced Status Messages
Added contextual messages to inform users:
- Missing API key error only shows when truly not configured
- Informative message explains when YouTube API is disabled due to Google Custom Search selection
- Clear indication that switching providers will re-enable YouTube API

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix
- ❌ Selecting Google Custom Search made YouTube API appear "Not Configured"
- ❌ Could not switch back to YouTube API
- ❌ Confusing error messages about missing API keys

### After Fix
- ✅ YouTube API shows as "Disabled" when Google Custom Search is selected
- ✅ Can freely switch between all three provider options
- ✅ Clear status indicators for each API state
- ✅ Contextual help messages explaining the current state

## Status Indicators

| API Key Present | Provider Selected | YouTube API Status | Badge Color | User Action |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|
| ❌ No | Any | Not Configured | Red | Add API key to .env |
| ✅ Yes | google-search | Disabled | Yellow | Switch to youtube-api or hybrid |
| ✅ Yes | youtube-api | Available | Green | Ready to use |
| ✅ Yes | hybrid | Available | Green | Ready to use |

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. `services/settingsService.ts` - Added `isYouTubeApiConfigured()` function
2. `pages/AdminPage.tsx` - Updated logic to use configuration vs availability appropriately

### Key Changes
- Separated "configured" (has API key) from "available" (not blocked)
- Updated UI to use `isYouTubeApiConfigured` for radio button enablement
- Enhanced status display with three distinct states
- Added contextual help messages

## Testing
The fix ensures:
1. YouTube API option remains selectable when API key is present
2. Appropriate status messages based on actual configuration state
3. Smooth switching between all provider options
4. Clear user feedback about current API status

## Result
✅ **Admin page now allows proper YouTube API provider selection regardless of current blocking status, with clear status indicators and helpful messaging.**
