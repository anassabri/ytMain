# Code Refactoring Implementation Plan - 2024

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive refactoring plan for the YouTube Studio Clone application to improve code quality, maintainability, and performance.

## Identified Issues and Solutions

### 1. Icon Component Duplication
**Issue**: Multiple icon components with similar patterns and inconsistent prop interfaces.
**Solution**: Create a unified icon system with consistent props and better type safety.

### 2. Loading State Redundancy
**Issue**: Multiple skeleton components with similar structures.
**Solution**: Create a unified skeleton component system with configurable layouts.

### 3. Component Prop Inconsistencies
**Issue**: Inconsistent prop naming and type definitions across components.
**Solution**: Standardize prop interfaces and create shared type definitions.

### 4. Context Provider Nesting
**Issue**: Deep nesting of context providers in App.tsx.
**Solution**: Create a unified provider component to reduce nesting.

### 5. Utility Function Organization
**Issue**: Some utility functions could be better organized and optimized.
**Solution**: Consolidate and optimize utility functions.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Create unified icon component system
